      <p>So, RCB reclaim the top position for now and remain the only unbeaten side of the tournament. Is it finally their time to rule? Well, too early but they certainly have begun well, winning the first three games of the season for the first time ever certainly is a step in the right direction. KKR continue to have too many stars but no real clarity in the batting department. This defeat will hurt them, even as they try to come out of the shock that the loss to MI was. Plenty of problems to solve for them but it's still a long tournament. Speaking of the tournament, we're running out of time as the next game of the double-header is coming your way. So, switch tabs and enjoy.</p>
